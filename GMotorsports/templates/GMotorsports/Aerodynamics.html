            <!--<p>The Aerodynamics subteam handles all external airflow over the car. With aerodynamically profiled body panels and the addition of a front wing, rear wing, undertray, and side pods, the vertical component of the force generated by these parts helps push the tires into the ground. In doing so, the car can accelerate faster, corner at higher speeds, and brake within shorter distances by significantly raising the tractive capacity of all four tires. Given that having an aerodynamics package is not required by our rules, the system must be holistically additive. As a member of aero, you'll develop a strong understanding of vehicle dynamics, work on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, structural analysis, and composites manufacturing. Anyone - irrespective of major and/or time of year - who has an interest in what we do will always be welcome to join.</p>-->
